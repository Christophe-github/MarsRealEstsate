## Architecture

This app heavily relies on the **Android Jetpack** components, notably using 

* Fragments
* Navigation
* ViewModel and LiveData (databinding)
* Room
* Test environment


#### Most of the UI is also built with the help of [Material Components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android)
